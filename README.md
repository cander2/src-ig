# Regulatory Correspondence FHIR Implementation Guide

This repository contains a FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) for standardizing **structured regulatory correspondence** from health authorities (e.g., FDA, EMA, PMDA) to market authorization holders (MAHs). For example, Health Authority Question and Response to Health Authority Questions.

The IG defines a FHIR based structure for list of questions / issues (also known as Request for Information), and decision letters to facilitate automated categorization, processing, and response generation.
